# tcping
kotlin port from https://github.com/pouriyajamshidi/tcping
粗糙的移植，不确保数据准确和是否破坏了原有逻辑。移植不包括命令行部分，程序需要手动调用。
Rough porting does not ensure the accuracy of result and whether it destroys the original logic. 
The porting does not include the command line part, and the program needs to be called manually.
